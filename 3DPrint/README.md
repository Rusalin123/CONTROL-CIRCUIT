In order to implement in an easy-to-view manner all that was announced above, we created a 3D design for a better presentation of the parking lot. 
The 3D design begins with the creation of a box to simulate the parking lot. This 
parking lot will be an outdoor one. The Tinkercad application was used to create the 3D design. 
This application is very friendly and encourages you to build 3D models, 
being easy to use and intuitive.
