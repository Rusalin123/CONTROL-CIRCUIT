# Schematic description
The description of this scheme begins with the power supply circuit. The power supply circuit receives a voltage of 9V from a battery and is stabilized at 5V. This voltage is agreed upon by the components and cannot affect the integrated circuits on the board. To build this circuit, a 7805 type voltage stabilizer is used. Considering the planned consumption of the circuit, a 7805 in a TO220 package is used, which can withstand a current of up to 1A. To avoid incorrect connection of the power supply, a 1N4001 diode (or another diode from the 1N4002, 1N4003, ..., 1N4007 series) is installed at the input of the stabilizer. Capacitors C1 (100nF) and C2 (100µF) filter the input voltage, and C3 (100nF) and C4 (100µF) clean the output voltage. Electrolytic capacitors eliminate low-frequency components, while ceramic ones eliminate high-frequency components. A green LED indicates the presence of 5V output voltage, and the current through LED is limited by resistor R1 of the order of hundreds of ohms.
