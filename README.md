# CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR DISPLAYING  FREE SPACES IN A PARKING LOT

The control circuit is designed to help parking lots and especially drivers.

Figure represents the block diagram of this system. We can see on the left side is the car entrance. The driver does not have to press anything, because this entrance is automatic. Its automation is done through a Hall sensor that senses the presence of the car, provides an impulse to the Arduino software, and this raises the entry barrier and gives an impulse to the counter on the PCB.

Just like the entrance, the exit is done the same, also automated through a Hall sensor, and by the presence of the car it provides an impulse to the Arduino software, raising the barrier and providing an impulse to the counter on the PCB. In order for the entire assembly to be embedded, we created a 3D design, where an outdoor parking lot is simulated where those created for the control circuit will be used to display the free parking spaces.
